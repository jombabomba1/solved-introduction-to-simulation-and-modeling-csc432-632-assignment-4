Interval estimation

Hypothesis testing

(Total of 10 points)




<u>Instruction:</u>

For this assignment submit a single file, either MS WORD or PDF in addition to your Python codes with descriptions. The Python codes need to have comments. The assignments must be done <strong>individually</strong>.

Format Requirements for all assignments:

<ul>

 <li>No page limits</li>

 <li>Single spaced, 12-point or larger font size; 1-inch margins</li>

 <li>Use headers and/or bullets to organize and convey key elements, and page numbers</li>

 <li>Only Latin alphabet characters are allowed (i.e., do not include any words or phrases that contain non-English characters)</li>

 <li>File type: Adobe PDF (recommended) or Word document</li>

 <li><strong>For the following questions you can use z-tables, Excel, or Python to compute the values for normal distribution. You can also use hand writing or Python codes to find out interval estimation or hypothesis tests (at your choice). If you decide to use Python codes, please upload the .py code in Canvas. In any case, you need to answer the questions and explanations in a WORD file and upload along your answers. </strong></li>

</ul>













QUESTINS:




<ol>

 <li>(1 point) Given that z is a standard normal random variable, compute the following probabilities.

  <ol>

   <li>P(z ≤ −1.0)</li>

   <li>P(z ≥ −1)</li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>




<ol start="2">

 <li>(1 point) Given that z is a standard normal random variable, find z for each situation.

  <ol start="2119">

   <li>The area to the left of z is .2119.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>(2 point) The U.S. Energy Information Administration (US EIA) reported that the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline is $2.94. The US EIA updates its estimates of average gas prices on a weekly basis. Assume the standard deviation is $.25 for the price of a gallon</li>

</ol>

H0: Mu &gt;= 20

Ha: Mu &lt; 20

<ol start="19">

 <li>A sample of 50 provided a sample mean of 19.4. The population standard deviation is 2.</li>
